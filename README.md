# TraceFileGen

The goal of this project is to design and develop a program that can automatically generate all types of basic memory management operations and write into trace files. Trace files can be used as further benchmarks for simulating Automatic Memory Management Systems (such as Garbage Collectors).

# Trace File

 A trace file is a collection of the following basic memory management operations in order to execute an application.  
* Allocation
* Store
* Read

# Trace File Format and Specification

 The trace file to be generated by traceGen has the following formats and meanings:
 
 MM Operations    											    	 | Notation
 ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------
 Allocation 													 'a' | a Ti Oj Sk Nl Cj
 Add a reference of an object to the rootset a threat  			 '+' | + Ti Oj
 Store/write a primitive field into an object 					 's' | s Ti Oj Ix(/Fm) Sn Vo
 Store/write a static primitive field into a class object 		 's' | s Ti Cj Ix(/Fm) Sn Vo
 Store/write an object reference field into an object 			 'w' | w Ti Pj \#k Ol Fm Sn Vo
 Store/write a static object reference field into a class object 'c' | c Ti Cj Ix(/Fm) Ol Sn Vo
 Read a primitive or a reference field from an object			 'r' | r Ti Oj Ix(/Fm) Sn Vo
 Read a static primitive or reference filed from a class object  'r' | r Ti Cj Ix(/Fm) Sn Vo
 Delete an object reference from the rootset of a thread 		 '-' | - Ti Oj	
 
 * Ti: i is a thread id (i >= 0)
 * Oj: j is an object id (j >= 1)
 * Cj: j is a class id (j >= 1)
 * Sk: k is the size of a object in bytes (k > 0)
 * Nl: l is the no. of reference slots in an object (l >= 0)
 * Ix(/Fm): x(/m) is the index(/offset) of a filed in an object (x(/m) >= 0)
 * Sn: n is the size of a field in an object (n >= 8) 
 * Vo: o is either 0 or 1 represents the field type either non-volatile or volatile
 * Pj: j is an object (Parent) id (j >= 1)
 * Ol: l is an object (Child)  id (l >= 1)
 * \#k: k is the slot number of a reference field in an object
 
# Obtaining TraceFileGen

# Installing (Initial Build)
  After downloading, followed by extracting or cloning, do the following:
  * $ cd TraceFileGen
  * $ ./build.sh

# Compiling (After Initial Build)
  After initial build, do the following:
  * $ cmake ..
  * $ make
  
# Running (targetGen - the executable in the build folder)
Usage: At least one argument must be provided to run targetGen
* The name of trace file to be generated (such as traceFile)

Example: $./targetGen traceFile

# Output (After after running)
	traceGen will generate three files
	* *.trace --- containing a sequence of memory management operations
	* *.cls   --- containing a lists of classes
	* *.log   --- containing statistical data, where * is the name of the trace file specified on the command line (e.g., "traceFile")

# Usages of Trace Files
	The obtained trace files can be used to simulate and analyse memory management operations by using TraceFileSim can be found in	https://github.com/GarCoSim/TraceFileSim
